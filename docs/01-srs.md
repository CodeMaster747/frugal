# Frugal — Software Requirements Specification

**Product:** Frugal — The Intelligent Financial Decision Platform
**Version:** 1.0 (v1 scope = Milestones 0–8)
**Status:** Approved for implementation
**Last updated:** 2026-08-04

---

## 1. Purpose and scope

### 1.1 Problem

Personal finance tools are retrospective. They categorise transactions and render pie charts of money
already spent. They answer *where did it go*, which is a bookkeeping question, and leave the user
alone with the question that actually matters: **what should I do next?**

The decision a user actually faces — "can I afford this ₹85,000 laptop right now, and what does it
cost me if I buy it?" — requires synthesising income stability, savings rate, upcoming bills,
committed EMIs, goal timelines, and cash-flow forecast. No mainstream tool does this. Users answer it
with a gut feeling and a bank balance.

### 1.2 Product thesis

Frugal continuously maintains a model of the user's financial state and uses it to produce **explained
recommendations**. Its defining property is not the feature list — it is that every score, verdict,
and forecast the product displays can be decomposed into the inputs that produced it. A recommendation
the user cannot interrogate is a recommendation they cannot act on with confidence.

### 1.3 Scope of this document

Covers v1 (Milestones 0–8): authentication, financial core, analytics, receipt intelligence,
categorisation ML, financial health, insights, forecasting, and the Smart Purchase Advisor.

Deferred to v1.1 and specified only at the interface level here: Market Intelligence (M9), Decision
Simulator and Notification Engine (M10), production hardening (M11).

## 2. Users

| Persona | Description | Primary need |
|---|---|---|
| **Priya — early-career salaried** | 24, first job, irregular saver, considering her first large purchase. | "Can I afford this without wrecking my savings goal?" |
| **Arun — dual-income household** | 34, mortgage + two EMIs, multiple subscriptions, needs cash-flow visibility. | "Will I be short before payday, and what's leaking?" |
| **Meera — freelancer** | 29, irregular income, no fixed payday, over-saves out of anxiety. | "What is my real runway, and is my emergency fund enough?" |

Meera is the hardest case and the best design forcing-function: irregular income breaks naive
averaging, so any metric that assumes a monthly salary is wrong. All engines must degrade honestly
under irregular income rather than emit a confident wrong number.

## 3. Functional requirements

Each requirement carries a stable ID. `MUST` = v1 blocking. `SHOULD` = v1 if time permits.
`LATER` = explicitly deferred.

### FR-1 Authentication & account (M1)

| ID | Requirement | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| FR-1.1 | Register with email + password; password hashed with Argon2id. | MUST |
| FR-1.2 | Login issues a short-lived access token (15 min, in memory) and a rotating refresh token in an httpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Lax cookie. | MUST |
| FR-1.3 | Refresh token rotation with reuse detection — a replayed token invalidates the whole family. | MUST |
| FR-1.4 | Logout revokes the refresh-token family server-side. | MUST |
| FR-1.5 | Google OAuth 2.0 sign-in, linking to an existing email account when one matches. | SHOULD |
| FR-1.6 | Profile: display name, base currency, timezone, locale. | MUST |
| FR-1.7 | Rate limiting on login, register, and refresh (per IP and per account). | MUST |
| FR-1.8 | Account deletion removes or anonymises all user data, including S3 objects. | MUST |

### FR-2 Financial core (M2)

| ID | Requirement | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| FR-2.1 | CRUD accounts (bank, cash, credit card, wallet, loan) with opening balance and currency. | MUST |
| FR-2.2 | CRUD transactions (income, expense, transfer) with amount, date, merchant, category, account, note. | MUST |
| FR-2.3 | Transfers create a linked pair and are excluded from income/expense aggregates. | MUST |
| FR-2.4 | System category taxonomy (two levels) plus user-defined categories. | MUST |
| FR-2.5 | CSV import with column mapping, preview, and per-row validation before commit. | MUST |
| FR-2.6 | Import is idempotent — a content hash under a unique index prevents duplicate rows on re-import. | MUST |
| FR-2.7 | Budgets per category per period (monthly), with rollover option. | MUST |
| FR-2.8 | Savings goals with target amount, target date, and linked account. | MUST |
| FR-2.9 | Recurring items (salary, rent, EMI, subscriptions) with cadence and next-due date. | MUST |
| FR-2.10 | **Demo data seeder** — one click populates 12 months of realistic transactions so every engine is immediately demonstrable. | MUST |
| FR-2.11 | Soft delete with 30-day restore for transactions and accounts. | SHOULD |

> FR-2.10 is a hard v1 requirement, not polish. Every downstream engine is meaningless on an empty
> database; without seeded data the first-run experience is a blank dashboard.

### FR-3 Analytics (M3)

| ID | Requirement | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| FR-3.1 | Dashboard: net worth, month-to-date income/expense, savings rate, health score, top categories, budget status. | MUST |
| FR-3.2 | Category breakdown with drill-down to the underlying transactions. | MUST |
| FR-3.3 | Income vs. expense over time; cash-flow waterfall. | MUST |
| FR-3.4 | Net-worth and savings-rate trend lines. | MUST |
| FR-3.5 | Budget progress with pace indicator (on track / ahead / over). | MUST |
| FR-3.6 | Arbitrary date-range filter; all aggregates respect it. | MUST |
| FR-3.7 | Aggregates computed server-side in a single query per widget; the client never aggregates raw transactions. | MUST |

### FR-4 Receipt intelligence (M4)

| ID | Requirement | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| FR-4.1 | Upload receipt image (JPEG/PNG/HEIC/PDF, ≤10 MB) via presigned S3 URL — bytes never transit the API. | MUST |
| FR-4.2 | Async OCR pipeline: perspective correction → deskew → denoise → adaptive threshold → Tesseract. | MUST |
| FR-4.3 | Extract merchant, date, total, tax, and line items, **each with an independent confidence score**. | MUST |
| FR-4.4 | Fields below the confidence threshold are flagged and routed to a review queue. | MUST |
| FR-4.5 | A receipt is never auto-committed as a transaction unless every required field clears threshold. | MUST |
| FR-4.6 | Manual review UI: original image beside editable extracted fields. | MUST |
| FR-4.7 | Duplicate detection against existing transactions before commit. | MUST |
| FR-4.8 | Job status is observable (queued / processing / needs review / committed / failed). | MUST |

### FR-5 Categorisation ML (M5)

| ID | Requirement | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| FR-5.1 | Merchant-string normalisation (strip terminal IDs, city codes, reference numbers). | MUST |
| FR-5.2 | Deterministic rules layer evaluated first; exact merchant matches bypass the model. | MUST |
| FR-5.3 | TF-IDF (word + char n-gram) → logistic regression classifier over the category taxonomy. | MUST |
| FR-5.4 | Predictions below confidence threshold surface as "uncategorised — needs review" rather than guessing. | MUST |
| FR-5.5 | User corrections are persisted as labelled training data and create a personal rule. | MUST |
| FR-5.6 | Offline eval harness reporting accuracy, macro-F1, and per-class confusion on a held-out set. | MUST |
| FR-5.7 | Models are versioned artefacts; the version that produced each prediction is recorded. | MUST |
| FR-5.8 | Sentence-transformer embeddings. | LATER |

### FR-6 Financial health & insights (M6)

| ID | Requirement | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| FR-6.1 | Composite health score 0–100 from six sub-metrics: savings rate, emergency-fund coverage, debt-to-income, budget discipline, cash-flow stability, financial growth. | MUST |
| FR-6.2 | Every sub-metric exposes its raw value, weight, contribution, band thresholds, and plain-language meaning. | MUST |
| FR-6.3 | Score is computed from a **published, versioned rubric** — no opaque model. | MUST |
| FR-6.4 | Insufficient data yields a partial score with explicit `caveats`, never a fabricated number. | MUST |
| FR-6.5 | Health snapshots persisted over time to render a trend. | MUST |
| FR-6.6 | Rule-based insight engine detecting: category spend deltas, budget breaches, new recurring charges, subscription creep, savings-rate change, anomalous transactions, emergency-fund shortfall. | MUST |
| FR-6.7 | Insights are ranked by materiality (₹ impact × confidence), deduplicated, and rate-limited per period. | MUST |
| FR-6.8 | Insights are dismissible; dismissals suppress recurrence of that insight type for a cooling period. | SHOULD |

### FR-7 Cash-flow forecasting (M7)

| ID | Requirement | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| FR-7.1 | Forecast projected balance at 30 / 60 / 90 days with confidence intervals. | MUST |
| FR-7.2 | **Tiered method selection by data availability**: `< 60 days` → recurring-item projection; `60–180 days` → EWMA + seasonal-naive; `≥ 180 days` → Prophet. | MUST |
| FR-7.3 | Response always names the `method` used, the `data_window`, and a calibrated `confidence`. | MUST |
| FR-7.4 | Recurring-transaction detection (periodicity + amount stability) feeds known inflows/outflows into every tier. | MUST |
| FR-7.5 | Shortfall detection — flag dates where projected balance crosses a user-defined floor. | MUST |
| FR-7.6 | Forecaster sits behind a `Forecaster` port so tiers are independently testable and swappable. | MUST |
| FR-7.7 | Backtesting harness reporting MAPE per tier on held-out windows. | MUST |

### FR-8 Smart Purchase Advisor (M8) — flagship

| ID | Requirement | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| FR-8.1 | User submits a purchase intent: product (searched or free-text) plus price, or picks from the seeded catalogue. | MUST |
| FR-8.2 | Prices are retrieved through the `PriceProvider` port. v1 adapters: seeded catalogue + manual entry. | MUST |
| FR-8.3 | Compute an **Affordability Score (0–100)** from: liquid savings after purchase, emergency-fund coverage post-purchase, savings-rate impact, committed outflows in the horizon, forecast balance trough, goal delay, and existing debt ratio. | MUST |
| FR-8.4 | Emit one of four verdicts: `BUY_NOW`, `BUY_ON_EMI`, `WAIT`, `NOT_RECOMMENDED`. | MUST |
| FR-8.5 | **Purchase Impact Simulation** — before/after comparison of balance trajectory, savings rate, emergency-fund months, health score, and goal ETA. | MUST |
| FR-8.6 | On `WAIT`, estimate the date the purchase becomes affordable, derived from the forecast. | MUST |
| FR-8.7 | On `BUY_ON_EMI`, model tenure options and show total interest cost against the cash price. | MUST |
| FR-8.8 | Suggest cheaper alternatives from the catalogue when the verdict is negative. | SHOULD |
| FR-8.9 | Every verdict returns a full `Explanation` — factor list with weights and signed contributions. A verdict without its factors is a defect. | MUST |
| FR-8.10 | Opportunity cost stated in concrete terms (goal delay in days, emergency-fund months lost). | MUST |

### FR-9 Deferred to v1.1

| ID | Requirement | Milestone |
|---|---|---|
| FR-9.1 | Market Intelligence: wishlist, price history, drop alerts, lowest-recorded-price tracking. | M9 |
| FR-9.2 | **Seller Reliability Score** — observable signals only (rating, rating volume, return window, warranty type, fulfilment type, price deviation from median). Rubric published in-product. | M9 |
| FR-9.3 | Decision Simulator for arbitrary scenarios (vacation, vehicle, job change). | M10 |
| FR-9.4 | Notification engine: budget, bill, renewal, goal-milestone, forecast-shortfall alerts. | M10 |

> **Scope correction from the original brief.** "Review Authenticity" and "Scam Risk" scoring are
> removed. Fake-review detection is not honestly achievable at this data scale, and publishing a
> "scam risk" label about a named commercial seller is a defamation exposure. FR-9.2 replaces it with
> a reliability score built only on observable, defensible signals — of which an outlier-low price
> versus market median is the honest proxy for the risk the original requirement was reaching for.

## 4. Non-functional requirements

### NFR-1 Performance
- p95 API latency < 300 ms for reads, < 500 ms for writes, excluding async jobs.
- Dashboard first contentful paint < 1.5 s on a 4G connection.
- OCR job completes < 30 s p95 for a 5 MP image.
- Forecast generation < 3 s p95; results cached until the underlying data changes.
- Any operation exceeding 2 s runs as a Celery job with an observable status, never a blocking request.

### NFR-2 Security
- Argon2id password hashing; access tokens in memory only, refresh in httpOnly cookies (NFR rationale: localStorage tokens are readable by any XSS payload).
- **Tenant isolation enforced in a base repository class**, not by per-query discipline. Every user-owned query is scoped by `user_id` at the data-access layer; a query that bypasses it fails a test.
- S3 buckets private with public access blocked; all object access via short-lived presigned URLs.
- IAM roles scoped to least privilege; no long-lived keys on the EC2 host (instance profile only).
- Secrets from environment/parameter store, never committed. `.env.example` documents shape only.
- Input validated by Pydantic at every boundary; SQLAlchemy parameterisation throughout.
- Security headers, CORS allowlist, CSRF protection on cookie-authenticated mutations.
- Dependency scanning and secret scanning in CI.

### NFR-3 Reliability & data integrity
- Money is `Decimal` / `Numeric(18,2)` end to end. Floating-point money is a defect.
- All timestamps stored UTC; timezone conversion at the presentation boundary only.
- Ingestion is idempotent by content hash.
- Celery tasks are idempotent and retry with exponential backoff; failures land in a dead-letter table with the error preserved.
- Migrations are forward-only and reversible; no destructive migration without an explicit backfill step.

### NFR-4 Observability
- Structured JSON logging with request ID and user ID on every line.
- Request ID propagated through Celery tasks so a job traces back to its originating request.
- CloudWatch log groups, metric filters on error rate, alarms on error-rate and queue-depth thresholds.
- `/health` (liveness) and `/health/ready` (DB + Redis reachability) endpoints.

### NFR-5 Quality
- Backend ≥ 80% line coverage; domain/scoring logic ≥ 95%. Coverage on scoring engines is what makes the rubrics safe to change.
- `ruff`, `mypy --strict` on `app/`, and an **import-linter contract enforcing module boundaries** — all blocking in CI.
- Integration tests run against a real Postgres and Redis (compose locally, CI `services:`), never SQLite; behaviour must match production.
- Every AI module ships an offline eval harness with fixture data and a recorded baseline metric.
- Playwright smoke test per milestone covering that milestone's user journey.

### NFR-6 Usability & accessibility
- WCAG 2.1 AA: contrast, focus visibility, keyboard operability, semantic landmarks, screen-reader labels.
- Colour is never the sole carrier of meaning — chart series and status states carry text or shape too.
- Dark and light themes, respecting `prefers-color-scheme` with a manual override.
- Responsive from 360 px; primary flows fully usable on mobile.
- Every async operation exposes loading, empty, error, and partial-data states. Empty states offer the demo seeder.

### NFR-7 Cost
- Runs at $0/month on free tiers (see §5). No architectural decision may introduce a paid dependency without an explicit ADR.

## 5. Constraints and assumptions

### 5.1 Technical constraints

| Constraint | Consequence |
|---|---|
| EC2 t3.micro = 1 GB RAM | Postgres and Redis **cannot** be co-hosted. Neon and Upstash host them. Rejecting all-on-EC2 is what makes the free tier actually viable. |
| Prophet toolchain ≈ 400 MB | Prophet loads lazily, in the worker only, and only for the ≥180-day tier. It is never imported by the API process. |
| torch / sentence-transformers ≈ 2 GB | **Excluded from v1.** TF-IDF meets FR-5 requirements at a fraction of the footprint. |
| Tesseract accuracy ≈ 60–70% on thermal receipts | Human-in-the-loop review (FR-4.4–4.6) is a functional requirement, not a fallback. |
| Neon free tier pools connections | Application connects via the pooled endpoint with `asyncpg` + SSL; Alembic must use the direct endpoint. |
| Python 3.14 on host vs. 3.11 target | All execution is containerised; the host interpreter is never used for app code. |

### 5.2 Product constraints

- **No scraping of commercial retailers.** Continuous scraping of Amazon, Flipkart, Croma, or Reliance Digital violates their terms, fails against anti-bot defences, and creates liability for a commercial product. The `PriceProvider` port isolates this decision so a compliant adapter (affiliate API or licensed data provider) can be introduced later without touching product logic.
- **No LLM in the decision path.** Recommendations must be reproducible and auditable. LLMs may later phrase explanations, never compute them.

### 5.3 Assumptions

- Single base currency per user for v1 (INR default); the schema carries `currency` per row so multi-currency is additive, not a migration.
- No bank-account aggregation (Plaid/Account Aggregator) in v1 — data arrives via manual entry, CSV import, and receipts.
- Single-region deployment.

## 6. Out of scope for v1

Bank aggregation · investment portfolio tracking · tax filing · multi-user or shared households ·
mobile native apps · real-time collaboration · actual payment execution · credit-score integration ·
LLM chat interface.

---

## 7. Acceptance criteria for v1

v1 is done when a reviewer can, against a deployed environment:

1. Register, log in, and land on an empty dashboard offering the demo seeder.
2. Seed demo data and see a populated dashboard within 5 seconds.
3. Import a CSV, re-import the identical file, and observe **zero duplicate rows**.
4. Upload a receipt photo, watch job status transition, correct a low-confidence field in the review queue, and commit it as a transaction.
5. See auto-categorised transactions, correct one, and see the correction persist as a rule.
6. Read a health score where every one of the six sub-metrics displays its value, weight, and contribution.
7. Read at least three ranked, non-duplicated insights.
8. Generate a 90-day forecast that names its method, data window, and confidence.
9. Ask the advisor about a large purchase and receive a verdict with a **complete, non-empty factor list**, an impact simulation, and — if `WAIT` — a dated affordability estimate.
10. Toggle dark/light, navigate the primary flow by keyboard alone, and use it at 360 px width.

**Global invariant:** any engine response returning a verdict or score with an empty `factors` array
is a bug, regardless of whether the number itself is correct.
