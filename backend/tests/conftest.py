Integration tests run against a real Postgres and Redis rather than SQLite:
behaviour must match production, and SQLite silently accepts things Postgres
rejects (partial indexes, CITEXT, NUMERIC semantics).

Locally those come from `docker compose up`; in CI from GitHub Actions
`services:`. Both are reached through the same TEST_DATABASE_URL, so the test
command is identical in either place.
