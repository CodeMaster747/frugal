"""Tests that tenant scoping is structural, not a convention.

This is the guard against the highest-cost bug in a multi-tenant financial
product: returning one user's finances to another. The test compiles each
statement to SQL and asserts a user_id predicate is present, so a subclass that
builds an unscoped query fails the build rather than leaking in production.

From M1 onward this suite parametrises over every BaseRepository subclass, so
new repositories are covered automatically as they are added.
