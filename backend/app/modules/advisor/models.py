"""Purchase evaluations.

Intensely personal, and persisted rather than computed-and-discarded so a user
can revisit a decision, and so the rubric can eventually be checked against what
people actually did.

The catalogue tables (`products`, `price_points`) started here in M8 and moved
to `market` in M9, which is where they are actually queried — M8 only ever read
the in-memory catalogue. `product_id` below still references `products.id`; a
foreign key by table name needs no import, which is what keeps this module free
of a dependency on the other's internals (ADR-001).
