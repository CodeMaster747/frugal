"""Categorisation feedback.

Every correction a user makes serves two purposes at once (FR-5.5):

* a **personal rule**, applied immediately so the same merchant is right next
  time -- the user should never have to correct the same thing twice;
* a **labelled example** for the next training run.

`predicted_confidence` and `categorizer_version` are recorded alongside so the
eval harness can distinguish "the model was wrong" from "the model was
correctly unsure". Those two demand opposite fixes: the first means more or
better features, the second means the threshold is doing its job.
