"""Celery worker entrypoint.

The app itself lives in `app.core.queue` -- a broker connection is
infrastructure, like the database engine, and keeping it there is what lets a
router dispatch a task without importing the task module (which would point the
dependency backwards through the layering).

This module's only job is to register the task packages the *worker* should
load. The API process never imports it, and so never pays for OpenCV,
Tesseract, or Prophet.

Workers run synchronously (ADR-006) at concurrency 1 on t3.micro: measured
footprint is ~450 MB during a Prophet fit or an OpenCV pipeline, so a second
concurrent worker is an OOM kill rather than throughput.
