// browser treats both as `localhost` -- one site, so the cookie below is not an
// issue there.
//
// In production it is the Caddy endpoint in front of the API, e.g.
// https://frugal-api.duckdns.org. Deliberately *not* NEXT_PUBLIC_: the browser
// never learns this address, because it never talks to it directly.

  // The refresh token is an httpOnly cookie set with `SameSite=Lax`
  // (backend/app/modules/auth/router.py), which a browser sends only on
  // same-site requests. Frontend and API are on different registrable domains
  // in production -- and `onrender.com` is itself on the Public Suffix List, so
  // even two Render subdomains count as different sites. A direct cross-site
  // fetch would therefore carry no refresh cookie, and every session would die
  // silently at the 15-minute access-token expiry.
  //
  // Rewriting keeps every request same-origin: the cookie travels, and there is
  // no CORS preflight on any call. The alternative -- `SameSite=None; Secure`
  // -- would work too, but it re-opens the CSRF surface that scoping the cookie
  // to /api/v1/auth was meant to close.
  //
  // Returning [] when unset leaves local development exactly as it was.
  // Kept to exactly the two paths the browser calls. `/health` on its own is
  // deliberately absent: that is the Financial Health page in this app, not the
  // API's liveness probe. An array return is matched after the filesystem, so
  // the page would win today -- but moving these to `beforeFiles` later would
  // silently replace a real screen with a JSON body, and that is not a failure
  // anyone would think to look for here.
