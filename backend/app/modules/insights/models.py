"""Generated insights.

The failure mode this schema is shaped against is **noise**. An insight feed
that re-announces the same finding every time it runs teaches users to ignore
it, and a feature people ignore is worse than one that does not exist -- it
still costs to build and maintain.

Two mechanisms prevent that:

* `dedup_key` under a unique constraint with `period_start`. The engine can run
  hourly and the same finding lands once per period, by construction rather than
  by the detector remembering what it said.
* `dismissed_at` plus a cooling period in the service. A user who dismisses
  "you spent more on dining out" should not see it again next Tuesday.
